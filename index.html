                    <p class="section_text_text">React Native is an open source framework for building Android
                        and iOS applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native,
                        you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as well as to describe the appearance and
                        behavior of your UI using React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can
                        learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how components work in
                        React Native.</p>

                    <p class="section_text_text">React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for
                        building user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to
                        understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve as a refresher
                        course.</p>
                    <p class="section_text_text">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>

                        introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need
                        names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                    <p class="section_text_text"><span class="span_bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native
                        use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScript like so:
                        <span class="span_bg">&lt/Text&gtHello, I am your cat!&lt/Text&gt</span>.</p>
                    <p class="section_text_text">The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX you can refer
                        to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are
                        declaring a <span class="span_bg">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
                        braces inside <span class="span_bg">&ltText&gt</span></p>
                    <p class="section_text_text"><span class="span_bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for
                        ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    <p class="section_text_text"><span class="span_bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of
                        props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
                        personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                        comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                        has an <span class="span_ital">onChangeText</span> prop that takes a function to be called every
                        time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be called when the
                        text is submitted.</p>
                    <p class="section_text_text">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their
                        words into a different language. In this new language, every single word is written the same
                        way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
